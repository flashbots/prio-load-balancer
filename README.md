# High/Low Prio Load Balancer

[![Test status](https://github.com/flashbots/prio-load-balancer/workflows/Checks/badge.svg)](https://github.com/flashbots/prio-load-balancer/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Checks%22)

**Transparent jsonrpc/http proxy and load balancer with high and low priority queue and retries.**

In the current setup, all requests in the high priority queue will be proxied before any of the low-prio queue.

## Getting started

Docker images are available at https://hub.docker.com/r/flashbots/prio-load-balancer

#### Run the program

```bash
# Run with a mock execution backend and debug output
go run . -mock-node

# add request for low-prio queue
curl -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_callBundle","params":[],"id":1}' localhost:8080

# add request for high-prio queue
curl -H 'X-High-Priority' -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_callBundle","params":[],"id":1}' localhost:8080

# Get execution nodes
curl localhost:8080/nodes

# Add a execution node
curl -d '{"uri":"http://foo"}' localhost:8080/nodes

# Remove a execution node
curl -X DELETE -d '{"uri":"http://foo"}' localhost:8080/nodes
curl -X DELETE -d '{"uri":"http://localhost:8095"}' localhost:8080/nodes
```

Note: there's a bunch of constants that can be configured with env vars in [server/consts.go](server/consts.go).

#### Node selection

* Redis is used as source of truth for which execution nodes to use.
* If you restart with a different set of configured nodes (i.e. in env vars), the previous nodes will still be in Redis and still be used by the load balancer.
* See the commands in the readme above on how to get the nodes it uses, and how to add/remove nodes.

#### Test, lint, build

```bash
# lint & staticcheck (staticcheck.io)
make lint

# run tests
make test

# test coverage
make cover
make cover-html

# build
make build
```

#### Node TEE attestation via TLS
```
# build prio-load-balancer with SGX and SEV support
make build-tee
```

> **IMPORTANT:** SGX and SEV attestation support requires additional dependencies. See [Dockerfile.tee](Dockerfile.tee) for details.

#### SEV Node aTLS attestation

```
# base64 encode the VM measurements

# Add the SEV execution node
curl -d "{\"uri\":\"https://SEV_${MEASUREMENTS}@foo\"}" localhost:8080/nodes
```

Execution nodes running within SEV and providing attestation consumables via constellations aTLS implementation are supported. The aTLS certificate of the execution node is automatically attested with the VM measurements which are submitted as part of the user part of the **node URI** (`SEV_<gzipped, base64url encoded measurements>`). You can read more about the attestation measurements in the [constellation docs](https://docs.edgeless.systems/constellation/architecture/attestation#runtime-measurements)

#### SGX Node RA-TLS attestation
```
# Add an SGX execution node
curl -d '{"uri":"https://SGX_<MRENCLAVE>@foo"}' localhost:8080/nodes
```

Execution nodes running within SGX and providing attestation consumables via RA-TLS are supported. The RA-TLS certificate of the execution node is automatically attested with the `MRENCLAVE` which is submitted as part of the user part of **node URI** (`SGX_<MRENCLAVE>`).

## Todo

Possibly

* Currently it works for jsonrpc requests. To make it work for any http request it would need to also proxy the headers and the URL.
* Queue rules: i.e. for 10 high-prio items, process 1 low-prio item
* Configurable redis prefix, to allow multiple sim-lbs per redis instance
* Execution-node health checks (currently not implemented)
* DoS protection / rate limiting (i.e. per IP)
